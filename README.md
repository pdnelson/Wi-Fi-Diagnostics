# Wi-Fi-Diagnostics
A program used that will tell you when your Wi-Fi goes out.

Problem:
  This was created because my Wi-Fi was acting up, and I needed it to work throughout the night.
I wanted to see what times I would lose connection to the interwebs, and if there was any pattern
to the connection loss.

Solution:
  This program will monitor your connection by pinging Google every so often. If it doesn't get a
response, then it will begin logging when the network disconnected. This should work as long as
Google's server is alive.
